Playing around with data visualization for the first time! This project started with implementing the BogoSort algorithm, a comically inefficient algorithm that sorts a list by randomly shuffling its elements until it just happens to be sorted correctly. I then ran a simulation of thousands of repetitions of this algorithm for lists of increasing size and graphed the average steps to a successful sort. I had hoped to do lists of length 1-10, but due to the massive time needed to sort larger lists, I was unable to graph beyond n = 7.
